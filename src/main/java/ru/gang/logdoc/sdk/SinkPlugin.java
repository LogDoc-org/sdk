 * SinkPlugin is an "input" plugin. It handles incoming streams and constructs LogEntry from bytes.
 *
 * Plugin is called by manager each time, when from socket came more than 0 and not more than maxReadBuf bytes.
 * Data is never repeated, it means when there are some bytes cannot be converted into LogEntry right now - its plugin's responsibility to store it untill tail data is received.
 * Data is not padded. It is breaked by socket flow or by time or by size. No one except of plugin must take care of it.
